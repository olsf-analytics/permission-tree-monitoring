# Permission Tree Monitoring Web App

This Web App exposes necessary information from the block explorer to create a DB of Permission trees for validators and miners of the 0L network. To learn more about 0L itself please follow the link: [0L introduction](https://github.com/OLSF/libra#readme) 

The stored data can be accessed through an API and the resulting graph data of Permission trees can be visualized through this Web App
